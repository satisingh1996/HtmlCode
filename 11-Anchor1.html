    <h2>About amazon information</h2>
    <font size="5">
        Amazon.com, Inc.[1] (/æməzɒn/ AM-ə-zon) is an American multinational technology company focusing on e-commerce,
        cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. It has been referred to as
        "one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world",[5] and is one of the world's most
        valuable brands.[6] It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet,
        Apple, Meta, and Microsoft.<br>

        Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington,[7] on July 5, 1994. Initially an
        online marketplace for books, it has expanded into a multitude of product categories, a strategy that has earned
        it the moniker The Everything Store.[8] It has multiple subsidiaries including Amazon Web Services (cloud
        computing), Zoox (autonomous vehicles), Kuiper Systems (satellite Internet), and Amazon Lab126 (computer
        hardware R&D). Its other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods Market. Its acquisition of
        Whole Foods in August 2017 for US$13.4 billion substantially increased its footprint as a physical retailer.[9]<br>

        Amazon has earned a reputation as a disruptor of well-established industries through technological innovation
        and "aggressive" reinvestment of profits into capital expenditures.[10][11][12][13] As of 2023, it is the
        world's largest online retailer and marketplace, smart speaker provider, cloud computing service through
        AWS,[14] live-streaming service through Twitch, and Internet company as measured by revenue and market
        share.[15] In 2021, it surpassed Walmart as the world's largest retailer outside of China, driven in large part
        by its paid subscription plan, Amazon Prime, which has over 200 million subscribers worldwide.[16][17] It is the
        second-largest private employer in the United States.[18]
