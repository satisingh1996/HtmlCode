                Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington,[7] on July 5, 1994. Initially
                an
                online marketplace for books, it has expanded into a multitude of product categories, a strategy that
                has earned
                it the moniker The Everything Store.[8] It has multiple subsidiaries including Amazon Web Services
                (cloud
                computing), Zoox (autonomous vehicles), Kuiper Systems (satellite Internet), and Amazon Lab126 (computer
                hardware R&D). Its other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods Market. Its
                acquisition of
                Whole Foods in August 2017 for US$13.4 billion substantially increased its footprint as a physical
                retailer.[9]
